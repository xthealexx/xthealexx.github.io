								<h2></h2>
								<p>The concept phase focused on creating and defining the project's main goals. The inspiration for this project was a cartoon lion cub, which will have a youthful and immersive design language; from wide eyes, defined brows and soft curvature, which created a challenge in translating this design into a wearable form due to the issue of it turning either cartoonishly oversized or ergonomically flawed. All of this meant that the design would need to take inspiration from the characters main features rather than copying its proportions exactly. 

During this early phase of range of technologies were explore the valuated based on how relevant feasible an accessible they were. Blender was chosen as a main design tool do to having more tools useful for sculpting characters, but also because of its wide use in industry for character modelling. Wall compared to CAD tools like fusion 360 which are better suited for precision engineering, also blender allowed for more artistic freedom which was necessary to help capture the more stylized and organic shapes needed for the lions’ facial features. 

3D scanning was also discussed and proposed as a way to make sure of the fear of the helmet around the user's head. By integrating a scanned base mesh, it would've helped the design to fair in real well dimensions, while also helping prevent scaling issues later in the development. 3D scanning has become a standard practise in both film prosthetics and high-end cosplay with workflows demonstrated by sources like      and        . However, due to Limited access to scanning equipment due to lack of specialised training and time constraints this idea was ultimately abandoned; however, this decision what later leads to some sizing concerns during modelling and potential fit issues had that helmet been fabricated. 

Furthermore, technologies such as motion capture were excluded from the beginning during this phase. Mocap is ideal for capturing real time expressions and motion data for animation or robotics like for example in projects like Disney's expressive and animatronic heads, however the main goal of this project was limited to a simple blinking mechanism. Also, the complexity of mocap, which requires specialised sensors, software integrating and real time data interpretation, would not have helped with the final product and was therefore scrapped due to it not being appropriate for this project. 

Aesthetic coverings in different materials were also considered, like for example resin and latex which were some early candidates to help simulate a more organic and flexible look for the eyelids. Latex is often used in prosthetic makeup, and it has a skin like flexibility, while resin can be cast for more clean and rigid forms. However, both of these technologies came with some significant drawbacks, like for example latex would not hold a set shape and could deform unpredictably and it is also difficult to control in mechanical settings like this one. While resin, which is more precise, is brittle and not suited for repeated motion. In the end neither of the materials was suited for the simple durable construction goals of this project, and were excluded before physical prototyping began. 

The blinking eyelid mechanism was designed from the beginning as the helmet’s one and only interactive feature. The goal for this mechanism is to create a servo driven system that could be positioned in the helmets eye socket area. Research during this phase included looking at hand puppet development and construction, DIY animatronic eye tutorials, Arduino servo control projects, some character prop examples form the cosplay community and finally some Disney animatronic projects. And although not fully implemented physically due to timing issues, these ideas helped inform the digital design and layout of the internal areas to house this kind of mechanism later in the production phase. 

This phase was important to understand and align final aesthetic goals with the more technical sides of this project. It helped define what was creatively essential, like for example the lion’s cartoonish expressiveness; also, what was mechanically achievable (a blinking mechanism using a servo motor); and finally understand what was out of the scope of this project like, for example, mocap. The concept phase has helped lay the foundation to help with the design journey.  </p>
